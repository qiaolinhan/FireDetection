# Abstract
Detect forest fire in early stage.\\
To detect the presence of smoke or flame.\\
To produce an estimation of the area under ignotion so that its size  can be evaluateed.\\
The organized dataset, composed by 882 images, was associated with relevant image metadata.\\

# Introduction
Overall in crease in temperature by 2$^oC$ cause higher level of dryness in the environment.\\
Among the available fire detection techniques, we emphasize the use of video cameras as **input source**.\\
* Aim: identifing a fire situation.
* Requires: 2 initial steps
  * 1. extraction of image descriptors
  * 2. feeds a posterior classification.
* Outputs: Together, these extraction and classification phases form the pipline of a *Deep Learning* model. The extraction
of discriptors return s unique properties that characterize an image by mean of a numerical vector.This vector is the output of a DCNN module.
