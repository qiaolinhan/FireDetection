# Enhanced Image-Based Visual Servoing Dealing with Uncertainties
Ahmad Ghasemi  February 10, 2020  
Many applications: UGV, UAV. Position-based Visual Servoing/ Image-based Visual Servoing.
Different: different kinds of controllers, $n$ of cameras  
Adaptive Switch Image-Based Visual Servoing, **Jicobian Vector**  
IBVS>Switch  
Dealing with feature loss: Increase the Speed of the IBVS, Limits maneuvering workspacce  
KF--Feature Reconstruction , also for noise filter
Flowchart  
Hybriad PD-SMC : robustness to uncertainties  

* Use camera to get more environment information  
* Better we can catch the moving objects
* callibration
* label the trajectory
* Be robust to the flash
* contributions (by publishes)
